		 * A priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties:
		 * Every item has a priority associated with it.
		 * An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
		 * If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
		 * 
		 * There is no priority attached to elements in a queue, 
		 * the rule of first-in-first-out(FIFO) is implemented whereas, 
		 * in a priority queue, the elements have a priority. 
		 * The elements with higher priority are served first.

		 * Priority queue can be implemented using the following data structures: 
		 * arrays
		 * linkedlist
